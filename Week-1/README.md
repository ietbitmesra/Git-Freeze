I used Beautiful Soup For web scraping the features of the phones. I used GadgetsNow website for scraping as this enabled me to scrap the features of both the phones using a single webpage.
I created a dataframe and then created a json file. Then I am running while loop infinitely, and in every loop I am checking the prices of the phones using Flipkart(For dynamic pricing), 
and if there is price difference, sendMail function sends a mail to the user, and also json file is updated. After every iteration there is a sleep time of 20s.
