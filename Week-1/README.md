# Problem 1 - Ankit's Phone

Ankit recently came 1st at a hackathon and now he wants to buy a new phone with the prize money he received. He is confused between iPhone 11 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Since he is very busy preparing for his exams, he needs your help. Give him a list of features comparing the 2 phones. 

## Basic Requirements

**Output** : A file containing [JSON](https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/) of the features of the 2 phones. (We'll leave the JSON format details up to you, but they should at least contain the Price, Operating System, Internal Storage, Camera features, Connectivity features and any other features that you would want to include).

## Next Steps

Once you are done with the basic requirements, get creative! Try to scrape the price of each of the phones at regular intervals and inform the user if there is a price drop via email/sms.

## Resources

You can use any language you prefer, but we'd recommend python ( Please don't use [python 2](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)! ) Make sure you read and follow the [coding instructions](../CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md). Here are some resources to get you started:
