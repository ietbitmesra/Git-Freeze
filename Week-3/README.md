# Problem 3 - Funny Lab Situation
Saksham is an awesome competitive programmer, and will use any free time to practice problems to increase his skills. One day in DS Lab Saksham opened the Codechef Online IDE to solve a couple of questions, but quickly found out that Codechef wa down (it was a Thursday :P). You need to help Saksham by creating a good text editor for him.

## Basic Requirement:
You need to implement a WYSIWYG GUI Text editor which suoorts the following operations:
- Have a window for editing text
- Save to and Read from a file
- Show Line Numbers
- Support for Undo and Redo operations

## Points to Note:
- You can use any GUI toolkit or library in any language of your choice. Examples would be TkInter for Python, Swing in Java, Qt for C++ etc.
- The text editor must be platform independent, so select a suitable technology.
